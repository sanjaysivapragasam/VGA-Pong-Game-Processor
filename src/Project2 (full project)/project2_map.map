WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator XST_GND failed to merge with F5
   multiplexer Vsync_not000110_f5.  There is a conflict for the FXMUX.  The
   design will exhibit suboptimal timing.

   multiplexer ball_y_velocity_mux0001<1>13_f5.  There is more than one F5MUX. 
   The design will exhibit suboptimal timing.
WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator XST_GND failed to merge with F5
   multiplexer B_cmp_lt0002242_SW0_f5.  There is more than one F5MUX.  The
   design will exhibit suboptimal timing.
WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator XST_GND failed to merge with F5

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Total CPU time to MAP completion:   3 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.
